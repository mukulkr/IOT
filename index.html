					<h1>Internet of things(IoT)</h1>
					<p>‘if one thing can prevent the Internet of things from transforming the way we live and work, it will be a breakdown in security’<br />
						it's not hard to explain why it's happening now. The sensors, networking chips and other technology required to connect to the Internet devices ranging from light bulbs to smartwatches to industrial equipment have all become inexpensive.

						These connected "things" send and receive data through the network relating to a variety of physical characteristics – temperature, moisture level, pulse rate, light level, velocity or revolutions per minute – as well as more complex data such as maintenance requirements, sounds, and static or moving images </p>

									<h2>Internet of Things (IoT) History</h2>
									
								</header>
								<hr />
								<p>Connected gadgets powered by the Internet of Things technology provides us with the ability to get things done from anywhere as well as everywhere. For people who travel a lot, connected gadgets are nothing short of a boon. Connected devices also come with an instant access to information. This includes the ability to find information within a fraction of seconds and that too, from devices that are probably at some other part of the world through remote accessing and browsing.</p>
								<p>Considering how much we use the Internet of Things term we thought it would be helpful to look at the origin of the iot.</p>

								<p>While looking into the next stages of this term and technologies there are many oportunities and challenges to face including privacy concerns, security, costs, standards, regulations, and the list goes on.

									Where do you think the IoT is evolving to next? </p>

								<p>- Projects like Cooltown, Internet0, and the Disappearing Computer initiative seek to implement some of the ideas, and the Internet of Things term starts to appear in book titles for the first time.
